        Python Markdown extension for embedding content using `OEmbed`_.
        
        PyEmbed-Markdown allows you to embed content in your Markdown websites and
        documents from a wide range of producers.  You don't need to configure
        anything - the extension automatically discovers how to embed content.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Initialize the extension like this:
        
        ::
        
            md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=[PyEmbedMarkdown()])
        
        You can then embed content by entering a link with the special text `!embed`,
        like this:
        
        ::
        
            [!embed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0)
        
        This will be turned into the following HTML:
        
        ::
        
            <iframe width="480" height="270" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9bZkp7q19f0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        For more information, see the `PyEmbed`_ website.
